2.   Addressing the missing values.
3.   Median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. 
4.   Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
5.   Summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
6.   Relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? 
7.   Investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with "Ale" in its name other than IPA).
8.   Useful inference from the dataset.
